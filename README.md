# Microstructure
This project will compare different methods of measuring the liquidity of stocks during a day. The main bid-ask spread measures are : roll, effective and realized liquidity; I will use some knowledge learned through the classes and also some key books about microstructure and liquidity to discuss the results. I will present the theory and after that I will discuss my results.
